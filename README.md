# a-quiet-place-backend

A Quiet Place Backend is an API designed to store the data of users making use of the single page web application. 

# Getting Started
To begin you'll want to clone down both this Backend repository and the Frontend. The instructions below will focus on getting the Backend up and running.  I'd recommend you completely set up the backend first to avoid a "server in use error."

# Installing
1. Open up your text editor's terminal and cd into a-quiet-place
2. Once in that folder, run 'bundle install' our gem-file is up to date so you shouldn't need to install any new gems
3. Run 'rails s' to get the server started
4. A localhost tab should open in your browser explore it to see the json data from our database
5. With the backend up and running you'll be able to log into the application once you install the front end.
